## Features

* Input a long URL → generate a unique short link.
* Redirect from the short link to the original long URL.
* Basic tracking / mapping of short code to full URL.
* Minimal UI to make the process quick and intuitive.

---

## Demo / How it Works

1. User opens the web page and enters a long URL.
2. The system generates a short code and shows the short URL.
3. When someone clicks the short URL (or enters it into the browser), it redirects to the original long URL.
4. The database stores the mapping between short code ↔ long URL.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python (Flask)
* **Frontend**: HTML + simple styling
* **Database**: SQLite (or file-based `database.db`)
* **Other**: Python modules as listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed
* pip (Python package manager)
* git (to clone the repo)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakeshln222/URL-Shortener-Project.git
cd URL-Shortener-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or whichever port is configured).

---

## Database / Data Model

* The project uses `models.py` to define URL-mapping models.
* A simple table stores:

  * **id** (auto increment)
  * **long_url** (text)
  * **short_code** (text / unique)
  * maybe **created_at** (timestamp)
* The `database.db` file is the SQLite database used for this mapping.

## Usage

* Navigate to the home page.
* Enter a long URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com/very/long/path`).
* Click “Shorten” (or analogous button) → you’ll receive a short link (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/abc123`).
* Share the short link / use it.
* Anyone clicking the short link gets redirected to the original URL.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add awesome feature"`).
4. Push your branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request and describe what you did & why.

Possible enhancements:

* Add analytics (click counts, date/time, referrer).
* Add custom short codes (user chooses instead of random).
* Add expiration dates for short links.
* Improve UI / responsive design.
* Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.).
